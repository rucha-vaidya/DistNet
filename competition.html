<h3>DistNet - Summary</h3>
 

  

<p>Distnet displayes techniques used in a distributed training algorithm for high-accuracy deep neural networks using Cuda on a cluster of nodes and a parameter-server architecture leveraging socket communication. 
      The main goal is to achieve similar accuracy as non-distributed training in lesser
      amount of time</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>
<p>Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception,
    labeling or clustering raw input. The patterns they recognize are numerical, contained in vectors, into which all real-world data, be it images, sound, text or time series, must be translated.
    Deep neural networks have more than a single hidden layer between the input and the output layer. Training the neural network is done through gradient descent and backpropagation. Deep neural networks
    with multiple convolution layers and followed by fully connected layers takes a long time to train due to the varying learning rates. To achieve high accuracy, the amount of data fed into these networks
    is extremely high, making the time for each epoch high. Training AlexNet on a single GPU(NVIDIA K20) takes about 100 epochs (6 days). Long training times for high-accuracy deep neural networks (DNNs) 
    impede research into new DNN architectures and slow the development of high-accuracy DNNs. Hence, we would like to explore the use of a cluster of GPU machines to accelerate the learning. 
    The speed and scalability of distributed algorithms is almost always limited by the overhead of communicating between servers; DNN training is not an exception to this rule.
    Therefore, the key consideration here is to reduce communication overhead wherever possible, while not degrading the accuracy of the DNN models that we train.</p>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<p>
 We are currently focussed on using data parallelism to reduce training time. We explore several flavours of data parallelism in terms of distributed computation and communication. Data parallelism can be achieved in two ways - feeding different input files and/or shuffling data before each run.

<h3> <b> Technology</b></h3>
<p>We use Tensorflow for CNN layer construction and all of the CNN related operations. Message sending between different nodes happens through the low-level socket API

  <h3>Preliminary Results with GTX 1080</h3>
<p>
  We did the correctness testing with the Nvidia GTX 1080 present in Gates Machines. Since communication between different Gates machines is difficult to achieve, we simulated multiple machines
      on a single node by launching multiple tensorflows that shared the GPU. Asynchronous performs better than other synchronous and locking mechanisms. The advantage of asynchronous will be even more
      pronounced when many more workers are used. The following graph represents the amount of time it took for each implementation to reach 86.1% accuracy.
