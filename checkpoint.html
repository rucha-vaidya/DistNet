<h3> Deciding Dataset and Platform (April 11 - April 12) </h3>

<p>Dataset:
After searching about datasets we finalized the CIFAR-10 dataset for the project. We made the decision because CIFAR-10 is a image dataset on which we could use convolutional neural networks. And since CIFAR-10 has 32x32 images, the single node version train in a reasonable amount of time</p>

<p>Platform:
Before decided to use CUDA and openMPI, but since our main focus was on distributing machine learning on several nodes, we didn't want to spend a lot of time, creating different layers of the architecture. We chose to use a machine learning framework that would help us with building the network architecture. Since neither of us had experience working on any deep learning framework, we decided to chose one that had good documentation and strong userbase, and hence finalized on Tensorflow</p>
We are using the following software stack
<ul>
	<li> Tensorflow 1.0 </li>
	<li> cuDNN 5.1 </li>
	<li> CUDA 8.0 </li>
</ul>
<p> We were initially going to test our implementation on the latedays cluster, but decided to use the AWS cloud/Google cloud platform instead</p>


<h3> Testing the Benchmark Code (April 9 - 11) </h3>

<p> OpenCVâ€™s package includes a dense RGB-D odometry example which we are using as a reference and as a benchmark. We have tested their algorithm against a few sample images. </p>

<h3> Implementation (April 13 - Present) </h3>
<ul>
	<li> We plan to implement RGB-D odometry on the GPU and then on the CPU. We spent 3 days, between April 9th and 11th, breaking down different parts of the serial algorithm, to understand the algorithm as well as to plan the potential parallelism in the algorithm. This was especially important while using OpenCV because it has in-built GPU specific data structures and functions. </li>
	<li> We began with Cuda implementation of RGB-D odometry. We have a preliminary algorithm up and running. We plan to work on optimizing the algorithm further, to get real-time execution. We will have some priliminary results up on the website within the next few days </li>
</ul>

<h3> Revised Project Goals and Parallelism Competition (Present - May 11) </h3>
<ul>
	<li> We believe that we will be able to produce real-time CPU and GPU implementation of Visual Odometry. Once we have this working, we will move on to the next phase, where we will be working on Loop closure. </li>
	<li> We intend to show a demo of real time camera tracking on CPU and GPU. We also intend to show a comparison between pure CPU and GPU based on energy consumption </li>
</ul>
